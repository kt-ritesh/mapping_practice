## Data Flow

1. The user sends a request to the application through the API endpoints.
2. The API receives the request and sends it to the appropriate controller method.
3. The controller method makes a call to the method in service class.

4. The method in service class builds logic and retrieves or modifies data from the database, which is in turn given to controller class
5. The controller method returns a response to the API.
6. The API sends the response back to the user.

## Functions used :-

### API Endpoints :-
</br>
<b> addAddress </b>

* PostMapping:

This endpoint makes a call to method in Service class which is connected to database. In database we add a new given through API.


* GetMapping: 

This endpoint returns all data through API.


* PutMapping: 

This endpoint makes a call to method in Service class which is connected to database. In database we update.


* DeleteMapping: 

This endpoint makes a call to method in Service class which is connected to database. In database we delete through API.

## JpaRepository extended by Repository interface.


We have used JpaRepository to implement CRUD Operations.
